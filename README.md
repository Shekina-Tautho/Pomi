# Pomi 🕒🍃

Pomi is a simple Pomodoro timer built with [Electron.js](https://www.electronjs.org/), inspired by a YouTube video from [@Nashallery](https://www.youtube.com/@nashallery).

It was made as a beginner project to explore desktop app development using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The goal was to create a timer that feels cute, calming, and personal — something you'd want to keep on while working or studying.
